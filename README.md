## Description
I plan to code an art piece of a heart made of flashing lines. Sort of like strobe lights. It can serve as a screen saver.
I used the math and turtle imports to create the heart and dashed lines. More specifcally I used math.cos() to string the lines from the center of the screen and make a fun pattern inside the heart shape. There's alternating colors within the drawn lines which I used turtle functions to do so. I created a list of colors and multiplied those by a large enough number as to create a lengthy program, but exterminate any lag the program would create. The overlapping colors give the lines a glowing effect mostly immenating from the center of the heart. 

Naturally there are areas I could improve. If you haven't noticed, one side of the heart is a bit taller than the other. I couldn't understand exactly why there was a slight difference when the code is very technical, but I got it as close as I could. I even used a website introduced to me in middle school for geometry. It helps creates equations to draw shapes using cosines and sines. This allowed me to get better approximations on the lines to create the heart shape. Another issue I could improve would be to figure out how to properly loop the color lists. The continuously looping colors caused the program to crash and there wasn't a way I understood how to delete lines drawn. There also wasn't a way to change the colors of the lines already drawn.

Besides my mistakes, I did acchomplish my checklist features. Them being the strobe effect, heart shape, and glowing effect. There are features that I added and loved after understanding more about the math.cos() function. The changing colors was something I thought would make the program look a bit more interesting. The singular color made the window seem dull and empty. Also adding the inner heart behind the main heart also made for a more interesting design. Creating the hearts was the most fun of the code. It was like a fun puzzle that I had to decode. Understanding more about math.cos and turtle helped me enjoy the process of seeing it be created. I think next time I'll add a few more hearts to fill the screen or glittery bits that rain behind it. These lessions has made programming easier to understand and more enjoyable to learn. I am excited to see what I can make next.
