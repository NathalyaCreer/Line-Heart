Control Scheme
-WASD to move
-Spacebar to jump

Innovation Added
-Player dies when caught
-Speedboost has more visual effects with speed

Difficulties
-AI should be implemented last after the scene is how you like, or else it will just spin around and not chase the player. Found a forum that said to delete the Navmesh and the ReconstructedNavmesh and replace it with a new one to fix the AI.
-Save feature acted a bit strange with the AI, not sure how to fix it, but it would disappear sometimes.
